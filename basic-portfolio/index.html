                        Most people describe me as a very techy oriented person. I'm an engaged dad that loves technology, everything from my Nest thermostat, Roku, and home studio to my Xbox One. My number one hobby is playing guitar along with creating music (modern rock).</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> I would have to say my second favorite hobby is hiking. I've been to Crowders Mountain, NC,  South Mountain, NC, and Stone Mountain, NC.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p>I served 4 years in the US Air Force in Minot, ND. Serving in Minot gave me a whole new respect for cold weather and I'm happy that I live in NC. I'm a die-hard Duke Blue Devils college basketball fan.</p>
